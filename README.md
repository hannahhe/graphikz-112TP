# graphikz-112TP
Welcome to my 112 term project, graphikz!

What is it? Graphikz is a graph transformer: A transformation from handwritten or digitally created graphs to LaTeX code with tikz.

What you need: An IDE, node.js/npm from https://nodejs.org/en/download/, terminal/command prompt.

How to run: 1. clone this repository into wherever you like.
            2. On terminal, "cd" into where the file "server.py" is, and run "python -m flask run".
            3. Wait until it loads and copy the server number, "Running on http://127.0.0.1:####/"
            3. On node.js, "cd" into where the file "package.json" is, and run "npm run watch"
            4. On your web browser, navigate to "http://localhost:####/" and press "ctrl+shift+'r'" to reload the page.

There are instructions on the website for how to use Graphikz! It is suggested that you create your graph drawing in Google Drawings or hand-draw your graphs and take a picture to upload.
